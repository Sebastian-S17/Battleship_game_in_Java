## Game Rules

- Each player has a grid (10x10) to place their ships.
- The standard ships in Battleship are the aircraft carrier, battleship, cruiser, destroyer, and submarine.
- Each ship occupies a specific number of consecutive grid cells, either horizontally or vertically.
- Players take turns guessing the coordinates of the opponent's ships.
